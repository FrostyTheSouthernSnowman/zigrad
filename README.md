# Zigrad

A lightweight micro-grad inspired library written in Zig.

My first project in Zig and first autograd engine. Expect some rough edges.

## Usage

Don't use it. It's not meant to be used. Just watch

[![Karpathy's Neural Network Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VMj-3S1tku0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0)

and reimplement it all for yourself in your language of choice.

The closest thing to usage you get here is running the unit tests with `zig build test`.
